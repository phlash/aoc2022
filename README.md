= Advent of Code: 2022

This year, I'll mostly be learning myself some [Scala](https://scala-lang.org/).

I'm not competing for any completion prizes (esp. as the puzzles unlock at 5am for me!),
but I am trying to solve all of them without cheating...

== Repo structure

Nothing exciting, although I may have a common utility library as well as per-day folders.

== Last year..

[aoc2021](https://github.com/phlash/aoc2021) I wrote solutions in Rust. Not used it in anger
since... maybe I should have contributed to some Mozilla code or Linux drivers? Ah well.
